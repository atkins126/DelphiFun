# DelphiFun

A collection of some functions I wrote for other applications or out of boredom.

# A look at IfThen

Every new Delphi programmer should be aware that in any common IfThen implementation, both return values for the conditions are
calculated by the compiler prior to calling the IfThen construct. This poses no problem when working with constants but will
when the calculations are costly i.e. when retrieving different rows from a database based on the condition.

Check the IfThen project for a solution using Generics and anonymous functions.

# Yet another TExecutor implementation

TExecutor executes a binary file either in foreground or background.

* callback functions for success or error
* Various methods to detect ending apps: by process id, image name, or image path
* Option to check if the binary is digitally signed

# Detect when a new drive letter gets attached to the Windows file system

Windows broadcasts new devices to all applications that have a main window handle using the WM_DEVICECHANGE message.
Unfortunately the necessary constants or structures are not included in Delphi 11 Community Edition.

This introduces the missing DBTTypes.pas unit and a sample app that notifies the user when a new drive appears or disappears.

# Read desktop shortcut and extract it's configured icon

Drop a desktop shortcut on this demo window and it will read the shortcut file, determine and retrieve the
appropriate icon.

# Intercept (duplicate) console application output

Now a tough one (I think)

There are hundreds of examples of how to **redirect** output from a console application to your own application. Basically you pass 
inheritable anonymous pipe handles to CreateProcess() which will then get attached to the console. It's your app which reads the
console app output from the pipe.

However, this solution has a major drawback: The console window is empty. So most people just hide the window with SW_HIDE.

A solution is to attach your own process to the child console applications window and echo the output while it's recorded with a
simple call to Write(). You can find an example in InterceptConsoleOutput.dpr.

Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/getconsoleoutputcp if you need to translate the captured output to your
codepage (e.g. when German "Umlauts" are broken.)

# WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) example to find your MachineUUID

The problem with WMI is not to get the information extracted, but to find it. There is a huge amount of information about
your computer and operating system waiting for you.

Of particular interest is the class Win32_ComputerSystemProduct which is used in this demo:

```
  Name                  : Parallels Virtual Platform
  Version               : None
  Caption               : Computersystemprodukt

```
Also of interest is the Win32_OperatingSystem that is a bag of information about your installed Windows:

There are dozens of other classes you can explore. Open a PowerShell window and use the following Cmdlet: **Get-CimClass** to get a list.

*  Win32_Share lists all network shares
*  Win32_VideoController fetches information about your video card

If Get-CimClass shows something of interest use the following Cmdlet to display all members of this class:

```
  Get-CimInstance -Class <Class> | Format-List *
```
